### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ I am currently applying for Computer/Data Science graduate programs. My interest lies in Machine Learning, Statistical Methods, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

ðŸ’¬ I completed a BSc. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in 2022 from [Rajshahi University of Engineering Technology (RUET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajshahi_University_of_Engineering_%26_Technology), one of the premier academic instituions in Bangladesh. My undergraduate thesis was on feature selection engineering for the prediction of loan default in a high-dimensional peer-to-peer lending system.

ðŸ”­ Shortly after that, I worked as a Junior Data Analyst at [Apon-Wellbeing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apon-wellbeing-ltd/), a Fair trade chain retail shop for lower income families. I mostly collaborated directly with the operations and supply chain teams, assisting them with product analysis, customer purchasing behavior, and used causal inference to forecast the effects of an offer.

âš¡ I am proficient in Python and MATLAB, and have experiences on working with Arduino and R programming language.
