### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ She/Her

ðŸ’¬  I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at Florida Atlantic University, where I am focused on building robust, generalizable machine learning models. My work leverages advanced techniques like time and frequency domain augmentation and contrastive learning to develop genomics models invariant to geographic location.

ðŸ’¬ I completed a BSc. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in 2022 from [Rajshahi University of Engineering Technology (RUET)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajshahi_University_of_Engineering_%26_Technology), one of the premier academic instituions in Bangladesh. My undergraduate thesis was on feature selection engineering for the prediction of loan default in a high-dimensional peer-to-peer lending system.

ðŸ”­ Shortly after that, I worked as a Junior Data Analyst at [Apon-Wellbeing](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apon-wellbeing-ltd/), a Fair trade chain retail shop for lower income families. I mostly collaborated directly with the operations and supply chain teams, assisting them with product analysis, customer purchasing behavior, and used causal inference to forecast the effects of an offer.

âš¡ I am proficient in Python (Pytorch, Tensorflow), R, and MATLAB with some proficiency in Arduino.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Genomics for my research.
